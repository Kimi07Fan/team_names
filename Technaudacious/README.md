1. We have made a Website which is a platform for hiring and promoting Artists in India.
2. There are seperate sign up and sign in facilities for both artists and people hiring these artists.
3. The sign-in is secure. Sessions in sign-in protect the state information between page requests.
4. The artists have their own homepage which shows their name, age, gender, city of residence, interests, experience in their field, contact details, their charging policy, etc.
5. Besides these informations, the artists also have facilities to upload their images, videos and links to their website, if any.
6. The website matches artists and people hiring artists by their place of residence and gives recommendations accordingly.
7. The users can also reject any recommendation that comes up to them in which they are not interested. Such recommendations will never pop up again for that user but still he can search for them in the search bar provided to both artists and users that are hiring.
8. The artists can also view other artists having the same interests, and who knows, they might end up making a band to perform together in events.
9. Besides these facilities, the artists can also view National/State Organisations in their country(India) which promote and preach their art.
